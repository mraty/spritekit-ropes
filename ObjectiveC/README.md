===============

Demo of iOS 7 SpriteKit and simple rope physics.

=======
Source code for my iOS 7 [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/SpriteKit_PG/Introduction/Introduction.html) physics demo. Demo has a simple rope, or more like a chain, which consists of nodes connected to each other with pin joints.

[Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jWdcbmnmKQ&hd=1) of the demo raised lot's of requests for the source code so I decided to share it here in the Github.

__NOTE:__ Source code is for a demo, so keep that in mind if using it in a product or in a game.
